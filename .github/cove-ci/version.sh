# Cloud Hypervisor's release tags, so its shape is the default here.
#
# v<upstream>-cove.<n>: upstream's version, then our own release counter on
# top of it. Replaces `git describe` output (e.g. v0.28.6-75-g50268b2d),
# which changes on every commit and which nothing can order -- measured
# 2026-09-18: Renovate authenticates, fetches, and proposes nothing, because
# "-75-g50268b2d" and "-81-ga71a1160" are not comparable.
#
# --validate and --is-release are deliberately the same test: a well-formed
# release tag IS what triggers a release build. One regex, both branches use
# it below, so they cannot drift apart.
#
# Exit codes 89-99 are a reserved "could not run safely" band -- the thing
# never ran, rather than ran and failed. 93 means a required argument (here,
# the subcommand or its operand) is missing or unrecognised. This script also
# uses two more (95, 96, below).
#   95 -- --next found no upstream vX.Y.Z tag reachable from HEAD, so there
#         is no base to build a version on.
#   96 -- --next could not establish that its view of existing <base>-cove.*
#         tags is complete before trusting an empty result to mean "no cove
#         release exists yet for this base". A shallow clone is one way to
#         be wrong about that (git rev-parse --is-shallow-repository); a
#         full, non-shallow clone whose fetch simply never brought tags (no
#         --tags, a checkout step that skipped them) is another, and looks
#         identical locally, and would hand back an already-released
#         cove.1. Local git state alone
#         cannot tell the two apart; only the remote's own tag list can, so
#         --next checks that too (git ls-remote against REMOTE, "origin" by
#         default -- override with VERSION_SH_REMOTE if that name doesn't
#         point at this fork; in a checkout where "origin" is upstream,
#         for instance) before trusting
#         silence. Reissuing a version number that already exists publishes
#         over a release, so this refuses rather than guesses. A refusal
#         costs a rerun; a collision costs a release.
#
# --validate's and --sort-key's own 0/1 exits are a separate, narrower
# contract ("well-formed or not") that predates this file's use of the
# 89-99 band, and are unaffected by it.
#
# VERSION_SH_SHAPE picks the tag shape, because the one thing that differs is
# how many parts the upstream version has:
#   warpgate: exactly three parts, vX.Y.Z-cove.<n>.
#   ch (unset or empty): Cloud Hypervisor's vX.Y (v53.0) or vX.Y.Z (v36.0.1) -- so the
#             describe glob takes two parts, and the base describe returns
#             must itself be exactly vX.Y or vX.Y.Z (95 otherwise).
# Anything else is 93: guessing a shape would validate the wrong tags.
